      <p>VIXILE Studios ("We", "Us", "Our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the information you provide when using our User-Generated Content (UGC) services in our games, apps, websites, applications, and software (collectively, "Services"). By accessing or using our Services, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
  
      <h2>1. Information We Do and Do Not Collect</h2>
  
      <p>We do not collect any personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it. Specifically, we do not store personal information such as your name, email address, or any other identifiable data unless you create content or participate in services that require such information as part of the User-Generated Content (UGC) features.</p>
  
      <p>When using our UGC features, such as creating and uploading content, you may be required to provide information specific to that content. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>The content you upload (e.g., images, text, audio, or other such material)</li>
          <li>Any other data that you provide through our Services related to the content creation or your account</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>We do not collect sensitive personal data, financial information, or other forms of personally identifiable information beyond what is provided through UGC creation.</p>
  
      <h2>2. Monitoring and Moderation of UGC Content</h2>
  
      <p>By accepting this Privacy Policy, you agree that your account and content created within our UGC services will be subject to monitoring and moderation by VIXILE Studios. This monitoring is done to ensure that content adheres to our community guidelines and terms of use.</p>
  
      <p>Our moderation may include both manual review and automated processes to identify and remove inappropriate or prohibited content, such as:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Profanity</li>
          <li>Discriminatory, offensive, or hateful speech</li>
          <li>Adult or sexually explicit content</li>
          <li>Illegal content</li>
          <li>Any other content deemed inappropriate or not aligned with our community guidelines</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>We reserve the right to remove any content that violates our policies, and repeated violations may result in the suspension or termination of your access to our Services.</p>
  
      <h2>3. Access to User Content</h2>
  
      <p>By using our Services and creating or uploading content, you agree that VIXILE Studios has the right to access, review, and moderate your content as necessary. We may access your content for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>To ensure compliance with our terms and community guidelines</li>
          <li>To address reports or complaints from other users</li>
          <li>To assist in the resolution of technical or customer support issues</li>
          <li>To comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>In the event that we need to access your content, we will do so in a manner that is consistent with the necessity and the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
  
      <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  
      <p>We do not retain personal information beyond the time necessary to fulfill the purposes of the UGC services. The content you create or upload may be retained for as long as it is part of our Services. However, if your content is deleted or if your account is deactivated, we will no longer retain or store that data unless otherwise required by law or for other legitimate business purposes.</p>
  
      <h2>5. Security of Your Information</h2>
  
      <p>While we do not collect sensitive personal information, we take appropriate security measures to protect the data associated with your account and the content you create. We use a combination of modern software & networking safeguards to ensure that your content is protected against unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.</p>
  
      <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  
      <p>We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make significant changes to this policy, we will notify you by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this document and providing notice within our Services. By continuing to use our Services after any such changes, you agree to be bound by the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
  
      <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
  
      <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or if you wish to contact us regarding your content or privacy concerns, please reach out to us through the contact options available within our Services. Due to the nature of our UGC services, please understand that our response may be subject to moderation or restrictions based on the content in question.</p>
